# About me

I am currently a M.S. student in Biostatistics at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia.

I graduated from the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong majoring in Optometry. I have worked as a registered optometrist for 3 years and encountered many interesting cases. I am curious about how to leverage data in guiding health related decisions and that's why I'm here.
